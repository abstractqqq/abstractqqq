## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a data scientist who loves hiking and playing video games. During my free time, you can find me either coding or drinking coffee or somewhere in the mountains ðŸ¤”. In the summer, I tend to stay home more and play video games.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Polars DS](https://github.com/abstractqqq/polars_ds_extension), a Python package that aims to modernize traditional Machine Learning with the help of [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Rust**, world history, philosophy, and enough math for me to implement various ML algorithms.
- âš¡ Also working on a close-sourced C game.
