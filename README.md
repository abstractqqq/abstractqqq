## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I am a data scientist who loves hiking and playing fromsoft games. During my free time, you can find me either coding or drinking coffee or somewhere in the mountains ðŸ¤”. In the summer, I tend to stay home more and play video games.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Polars DS](https://github.com/abstractqqq/polars_ds_extension), a Python package that aims to modernize traditional Machine Learning with the help of [Polars](https://github.com/pola-rs/polars)
- ðŸ‘¯ If you want a Rust-based dynamic (dimension is not known at compile-time) Kd-tree, see [here](https://github.com/abstractqqq/arkadia). I want to package it one day and I might need some help with that. But first I want to expand it by adding some approximate vector search algorithms.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Rust**, world history, philosophy, and enough math for me to implement various ML algorithms. One day I will learn **C**. One day.
